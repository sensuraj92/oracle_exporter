# Oracle Database Exporter

Prometheus exporter for Oracle Database metrics. This exporter is based on MySQL Server Exporter (https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter).

This exporter is going to support Oracle 11g and newer.

This exporter is still in development. Please do not use it yet.

**This Project is on hold!**

Prometheus is a great project but I cannot visualize information as I would like to. The default gui graphana is very limited in some areas. Maybe I'll continue later. For the time being you can use https://github.com/iamseth/oracledb_exporter to monitor Oracle Databases.

Cheers!
